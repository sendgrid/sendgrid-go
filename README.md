**NEW:** Subscribe to email [notifications](https://dx.sendgrid.com/newsletter/go) for releases and breaking changes.

**The default branch name for this repository has been changed to `main` as of 07/27/2020.**

**This library allows you to quickly and easily use the Twilio SendGrid Web API v3 via Go.**

Version 3.X.X of this library provides full support for all Twilio SendGrid [Web API v3](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html) endpoints, including the new [v3 /mail/send](https://sendgrid.com/blog/introducing-v3mailsend-sendgrids-new-mail-endpoint).

This library represents the beginning of a new path for Twilio SendGrid. We want this library to be community driven and Twilio SendGrid led. We need your help to realize this goal. To help make sure we are building the right things in the right order, we ask that you create [issues](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go/issues) and [pull requests](CONTRIBUTING.md) or simply upvote or comment on existing issues or pull requests.

Please browse the rest of this README for further detail.

We appreciate your continued support, thank you!

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Go version 1.7

echo "sendgrid.env" >> .gitignore
source ./sendgrid.env
```

# Quick Start

## Hello Email

The following is the minimum needed code to send an email with the [/mail/send Helper](helpers/mail) ([here](examples/helpers/mail/example.go#L32) is a full example):

### With Mail Helper Class

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go"
	"github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go/helpers/mail"
)

func main() {
	from := mail.NewEmail("Example User", "test@example.com")
	subject := "Sending with Twilio SendGrid is Fun"
	to := mail.NewEmail("Example User", "test@example.com")
	plainTextContent := "and easy to do anywhere, even with Go"
	htmlContent := "<strong>and easy to do anywhere, even with Go</strong>"
	message := mail.NewSingleEmail(from, subject, to, plainTextContent, htmlContent)
	client := sendgrid.NewSendClient(os.Getenv("SENDGRID_API_KEY"))
	response, err := client.Send(message)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println(response.StatusCode)
		fmt.Println(response.Body)
		fmt.Println(response.Headers)
	}
}
```

The `NewEmail` constructor creates a [personalization object](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/personalizations.html) for you. [Here](examples/helpers/mail/example.go#L28) is an example of how to add to it.

### Without Mail Helper Class

The following is the minimum needed code to send an email without the /mail/send Helper ([here](examples/mail/mail.go#L47) is a full example):

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	request := sendgrid.GetRequest(os.Getenv("SENDGRID_API_KEY"), "/v3/mail/send", "https://api.sendgrid.com")
	request.Method = "POST"
	request.Body = []byte(` {
	"personalizations": [
		{
			"to": [
				{
					"email": "test@example.com"
				}
			],
			"subject": "Sending with Twilio SendGrid is Fun"
		}
	],
	"from": {
		"email": "test@example.com"
	},
	"content": [
		{
			"type": "text/plain",
			"value": "and easy to do anywhere, even with Go"
		}
	]
}`)
	response, err := sendgrid.API(request)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println(response.StatusCode)
		fmt.Println(response.Body)
		fmt.Println(response.Headers)
	}
}
```

## General v3 Web API Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	request := sendgrid.GetRequest(os.Getenv("SENDGRID_API_KEY"), "/v3/api_keys", "https://api.sendgrid.com")
	request.Method = "GET"

	response, err := sendgrid.API(request)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println(response.StatusCode)
		fmt.Println(response.Body)
		fmt.Println(response.Headers)
	}
}
```
