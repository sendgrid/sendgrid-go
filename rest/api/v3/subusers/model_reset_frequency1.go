* The Twilio SendGrid Subusers API allows you to create and manage your Subuser accounts. Subusers are available on [Pro and Premier plans](https://sendgrid.com/pricing), and you can think of them as sub-accounts. Each Subuser can have its own sending domains, IP addresses, and reporting. SendGrid recommends creating Subusers for each of the different types of emails you sendâ€”one Subuser for transactional emails and another for marketing emails. Independent Software Vendor (ISV) customers may also create Subusers for each of their customers.  You can also manage Subusers in the [Twilio SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/subusers). See [**Subusers**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/subusers) for more information.
