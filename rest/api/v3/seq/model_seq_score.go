* The SendGrid Engagement Quality (SEQ) API allows you to retrieve metrics that define the quality of your email program.  An SEQ score is correlated with: - The quality of the data in a sender’s program. - How “wanted” the sender's email is by their recipients.  Because “wanted” email and deliverability are closely related, a higher SEQ metric is correlated with greater deliverability. This means the higher your SEQ score, the more likely you are to land in your recipients' inboxes. See the SEQ Overview page to understand SEQ, how it's calculated, and how you can address your score. The SEQ endpoints allow you to retrieve your scores and scores for your Subusers.

// SeqScore A user's SendGrid Engagement Quality (SEQ) score for a specified date. Your SEQ score is determined by measuring several key metrics including your open rate, spam rate, and engagement recency. Your overall score allows you to quickly assess how your email program is performing at a high level. You will receive a score from `1` to `5` with a higher number representing better engagement quality. See the `metrics` property to understand how your program is performing across the input categories that determine your overall score.
