* The SendGrid Engagement Quality (SEQ) API allows you to retrieve metrics that define the quality of your email program.  An SEQ score is correlated with: - The quality of the data in a sender’s program. - How “wanted” the sender's email is by their recipients.  Because “wanted” email and deliverability are closely related, a higher SEQ metric is correlated with greater deliverability. This means the higher your SEQ score, the more likely you are to land in your recipients' inboxes. See the SEQ Overview page to understand SEQ, how it's calculated, and how you can address your score. The SEQ endpoints allow you to retrieve your scores and scores for your Subusers.
