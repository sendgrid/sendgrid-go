* Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Contacts API
* The Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Contacts API allows you to manage all of your marketing contacts programmatically. You can also import and export contacts using this API. The Contacts API allows you to associate contacts with lists and segments; however, to manage the lists and segments themselves, see the [Lists API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/lists/) and [Segments API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/segmenting-contacts-v2/).  You can also manage your marketing contacts with the [Marketing Campaigns application user interface](https://mc.sendgrid.com/contacts). See [**How to Send Email with New Marketing Campaigns**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-email-with-marketing-campaigns) for more information.
