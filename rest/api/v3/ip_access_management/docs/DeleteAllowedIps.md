## DeleteAllowedIps

> map[string]interface{} DeleteAllowedIps(ctx, optional)

Remove one or more IPs from the allow list

**This endpoint allows you to remove one or more IP addresses from your list of allowed addresses.**  To remove one or more IP addresses, pass this endpoint an array containing the ID(s) associated with the IP(s) you intend to remove. You can retrieve the IDs associated with your allowed IP addresses using the \"Retrieve a list of currently allowed IPs\" endpoint.  It is possible to remove your own IP address, which will block access to your account. You will need to submit a [support ticket](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/support/) if this happens. For this reason, it is important to double check that you are removing only the IPs you intend to remove when using this endpoint.

### Path Parameters

This endpoint does not need any path parameter.

### Other Parameters

Other parameters are passed through a pointer to a DeleteAllowedIpsParams struct

**Onbehalfof** | **string** | The `on-behalf-of` header allows you to make API calls from a parent account on behalf of the parent's Subusers or customer accounts. You will use the parent account's API key when using this header. When making a call on behalf of a customer account, the property value should be \"account-id\" followed by the customer account's ID (e.g., `on-behalf-of: account-id <account-id>`). When making a call on behalf of a Subuser, the property value should be the Subuser's username (e.g., `on-behalf-of: <subuser-username>`). See [**On Behalf Of**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/on-behalf-of) for more information.
