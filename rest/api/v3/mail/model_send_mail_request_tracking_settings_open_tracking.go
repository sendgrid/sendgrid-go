The Mail Send endpoint supports many levels of functionality, allowing you to send templates, set categories and custom arguments that can be used to analyze your send, and configure which tracking settings to include such as opens and clicks. You can also group mail sends into batches, allowing you to schedule and cancel sends by their batch IDs.

When the message is opened, a request for the pixel is sent. That request indicates to Twilio SendGrid that the message was opened.

	// Indicates if this setting is enabled.
	Enable *bool `json:"enable,omitempty"`
	// Allows you to specify a substitution tag that you can insert in the body of your email at a location that you desire. This tag will be replaced by the open tracking pixel.
