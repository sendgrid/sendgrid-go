The Mail Send endpoint supports many levels of functionality, allowing you to send templates, set categories and custom arguments that can be used to analyze your send, and configure which tracking settings to include such as opens and clicks. You can also group mail sends into batches, allowing you to schedule and cancel sends by their batch IDs.

// SendMailRequestMailSettingsBypassListManagement Allows you to bypass all unsubscribe groups and suppressions to ensure that the email is delivered to every single recipient. This should only be used in emergencies when it is absolutely necessary that every recipient receives your email. This filter cannot be combined with any other bypass filters. See the [the \"Bypass suppressions\" section of our **Suppressions Overview**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions) for more about bypass filters.
