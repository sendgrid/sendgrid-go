* The Twilio SendGrid Legacy Marketing Campaigns Campaigns API allows you to manage your marketing email messages programmatically. This API is operational, but we recommend using the current version of Marketing Campaigns to manage your marketing messages with SendGrid [Single Sends](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/single-sends/) and [Automations](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/getting-started-with-automation).  See [**Migrating from Legacy Marketing Campaigns**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/migrating-from-legacy-marketing-campaigns) for more information.
