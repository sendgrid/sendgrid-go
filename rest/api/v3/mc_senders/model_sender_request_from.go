* The Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Senders API allows you to create a verified sender from which your marketing emails will be sent. To ensure our customers maintain the best possible sender reputations and to uphold legitimate sending behavior, we require customers to verify their Senders. A Sender represents your “From” email address—the address your recipients will see as the sender of your emails.
