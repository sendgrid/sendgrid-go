* The Twilio SendGrid IP Address Management API combines functionality that was previously split between the Twilio SendGrid [IP Address API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/ip-address) and [IP Pools API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/ip-pools). This functionality includes adding IP addresses to your account, assigning IP addresses to IP Pools and Subusers, among other tasks.
