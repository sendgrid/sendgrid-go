* Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Lists API
* The Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Lists API allows you to manage your contacts lists programmatically. Lists are static collections of Marketing Campaigns contacts. You can use this API to interact with the list objects themselves. To add contacts to a list, you must use the [Contacts API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/contacts/).  You can also manage your lists using the Contacts menu in the [Marketing Campaigns application user interface](https://mc.sendgrid.com/contacts). For more information about lists and best practices for building them, see [**Building your Contact Lists**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/managing-contacts/building-your-contact-list/).
