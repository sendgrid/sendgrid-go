* The Twilio SendGrid Designs API offers the ability to manage assets stored in the Twilio SendGrid [Design Library](https://mc.sendgrid.com/design-library/my-designs).  The Design Library is a feature-rich email layout tool and media repository. You can [build designs for all your marketing email needs](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/working-with-marketing-campaigns-email-designs/), including Single Sends and Automations.  You can also duplicate and then modify one of the pre-built designs provided by Twilio SendGrid to get you started.  The Designs API provides a REST-like interface for creating new designs, retrieving a list of existing designs, duplicating or updating a design, and deleting a design.

// **This endpoint allows you to create a new design**.  You can add a new design by passing data, including a string of HTML email content, to `/designs`. When creating designs from scratch, be aware of the styling constraints inherent to many email clients. For a list of best practices, see our guide to [Cross-Platform Email Design](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/cross-platform-html-design/).  The Design Library can also convert your designâ€™s HTML elements into drag and drop modules that are editable in the Designs Library user interface. For more, visit the [Design and Code Editor documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/editor/#drag--drop-markup).  Because the `/designs` endpoint makes it easy to add designs, you can create a design with your preferred tooling or migrate designs you already own without relying on the Design Library UI.
