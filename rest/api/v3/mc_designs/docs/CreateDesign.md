Create Design

**This endpoint allows you to create a new design**.  You can add a new design by passing data, including a string of HTML email content, to `/designs`. When creating designs from scratch, be aware of the styling constraints inherent to many email clients. For a list of best practices, see our guide to [Cross-Platform Email Design](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/cross-platform-html-design/).  The Design Library can also convert your designâ€™s HTML elements into drag and drop modules that are editable in the Designs Library user interface. For more, visit the [Design and Code Editor documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/editor/#drag--drop-markup).  Because the `/designs` endpoint makes it easy to add designs, you can create a design with your preferred tooling or migrate designs you already own without relying on the Design Library UI.

### Path Parameters

This endpoint does not need any path parameter.
