Duplicate SendGrid Pre-built Design

**This endpoint allows you to duplicate one of the pre-built Twilio SendGrid designs**.  Like duplicating one of your existing designs, you are not required to pass any data in the body of a request to this endpoint. If you choose to leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate will be assigned the name of the design it was copied from with the text \"Duplicate: \" prepended to it. This name change is only a convenience, as the duplicate design will be assigned a unique ID that differentiates it from your other designs. You can retrieve the IDs for Twilio SendGrid pre-built designs using the \"List SendGrid Pre-built Designs\" endpoint.  You can modify your duplicateâ€™s name at the time of creation by passing an updated value to the `name` field when making the initial request. More on retrieving design IDs can be found above.
