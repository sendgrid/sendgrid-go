* Twilio SendGrid Enforced TLS API
* The Twilio SendGrid Enforced TLS API allows you to specify whether or not the recipient of your mail send is required to support TLS or have a valid certificate.  Twilio SendGrid sends all emails with [Opportunistic TLS](https://sendgrid.com/blog/myth-opportunistic-tls-email-privacy/) by default, meaning email is sent with TLS, and if the recipient's inbox provider does not accept the TLS encryption, we then send the message unencrypted.  You can optionally choose to enforce TLS encryption, meaning that if the recipient's inbox provider does not accept the TLS encryption, Twilio SendGrid drops the message and sends a block event with the message, “TLS required but not supported” as the description.
