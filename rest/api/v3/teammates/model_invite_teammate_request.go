* Twilio SendGrid Teammates API
* The Twilio SendGrid Teammates API allows you to add, manage, and remove Teammates, or user accounts, from your SendGrid account. Teammates function like user accounts on the SendGrid account, allowing you to invite additional users to your account with scoped access. You can think of Teammates as SendGrid's approach to enabling [role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) for your SendGrid account. For even more control over the access to your account, see the [Twilio SendGrid SSO API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/single-sign-on-teammates/), which enables SSO-authenticated Teammates to be managed through a SAML 2.0 identity provider.
