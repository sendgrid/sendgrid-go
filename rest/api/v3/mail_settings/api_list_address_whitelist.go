* The Twilio SendGrid Mail Settings API allows you to retrieve and configure the various Mail Settings available. Mail Settings instruct SendGrid to apply specific settings to every email that you send over [SendGridâ€™s Web API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/v3-mail-send) or [SMTP relay](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/building-an-x-smtpapi-header/). These settings include how to embed a custom footer, how to manage blocks, spam, and bounces, and more.  For a full list of Twilio SendGrid's Mail Settings, and what each one does, see [**Mail Settings**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/mail/).  You can also manage your Mail Settings in the Twilio SendGrid application user interface.

You will use the parent account's API key when using this header. When making a call on behalf of a customer account, the property value should be \"account-id\" followed by the customer account's ID (e.g., `on-behalf-of: account-id <account-id>`). When making a call on behalf of a Subuser, the property value should be the Subuser's username (e.g., `on-behalf-of: <subuser-username>`).

// **This endpoint allows you to retrieve your current email address whitelist settings.**  The Address Whitelist setting allows you to specify email addresses or domains for which mail should never be suppressed.  For example, if you own the domain `example.com`, and one or more of your recipients use `email@example.com` addresses, placing `example.com` in the address whitelist setting instructs Twilio SendGrid to ignore all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes logged for that domain. In other words, all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes will still be sent to `example.com` as if they were sent under normal sending conditions.
