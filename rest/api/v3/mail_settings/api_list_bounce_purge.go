* The Twilio SendGrid Mail Settings API allows you to retrieve and configure the various Mail Settings available. Mail Settings instruct SendGrid to apply specific settings to every email that you send over [SendGridâ€™s Web API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/v3-mail-send) or [SMTP relay](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/building-an-x-smtpapi-header/). These settings include how to embed a custom footer, how to manage blocks, spam, and bounces, and more.  For a full list of Twilio SendGrid's Mail Settings, and what each one does, see [**Mail Settings**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/mail/).  You can also manage your Mail Settings in the Twilio SendGrid application user interface.

You will use the parent account's API key when using this header. When making a call on behalf of a customer account, the property value should be \"account-id\" followed by the customer account's ID (e.g., `on-behalf-of: account-id <account-id>`). When making a call on behalf of a Subuser, the property value should be the Subuser's username (e.g., `on-behalf-of: <subuser-username>`). See [**On Behalf Of**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/on-behalf-of) for more information.

// **This endpoint allows you to retrieve your current bounce and purge settings.**  The Bounce Perge setting allows you to set a schedule that Twilio SendGrid will use to automatically delete contacts from your soft and hard bounce suppression lists.  A hard bounce occurs when an email message has been returned to the sender because the recipient's address is invalid. A hard bounce might occur because the domain name doesn't exist or because the recipient is unknown.  A soft bounce occurs when an email message reaches the recipient's mail server but is bounced back undelivered before it actually reaches the recipient. A soft bounce might occur because the recipient's inbox is full.  You can also manage this setting in the [Mail Settings section of the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings). You can manage your bounces manually using the [Bounces API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/bounces-api) or the [Bounces menu in the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/suppressions/bounces).
