* Twilio SendGrid Mail Settings API
* The Twilio SendGrid Mail Settings API allows you to retrieve and configure the various Mail Settings available. Mail Settings instruct SendGrid to apply specific settings to every email that you send over [SendGridâ€™s Web API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/v3-mail-send) or [SMTP relay](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/building-an-x-smtpapi-header/). These settings include how to embed a custom footer, how to manage blocks, spam, and bounces, and more.  For a full list of Twilio SendGrid's Mail Settings, and what each one does, see [**Mail Settings**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/mail/).  You can also manage your Mail Settings in the Twilio SendGrid application user interface.
