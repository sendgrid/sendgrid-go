* Twilio SendGrid Reverse DNS API
* The Twilio SendGrid Reverse DNS API (formerly IP Whitelabel) allows you to configure reverse DNS settings for your account. Mailbox providers verify the sender of your emails by performing a reverse DNS lookup.  When setting up Reverse DNS, Twilio SendGrid will provide an A Record (address record) for you to add to the DNS records of your sending domain. The A record maps your sending domain to a dedicated Twilio SendGrid IP address. Once Twilio SendGrid has verified that the appropriate A record for the IP address has been created, the appropriate reverse DNS record for the IP address is generated.  Reverse DNS is available for [dedicated IP addresses](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/dedicated-ip-addresses/) only.  You can also manage your reverse DNS settings in the Sender Authentication setion of the [Twilio SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth).  See [**How to Set Up Reverse DNS**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-reverse-dns/) for more information.
