* Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Custom Fields API
* The Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Custom Fields API allows you to add extra information about your marketing contacts that is relevant to your needs. For example, a fashion retailer might create a custom field for customers' shoe sizes, an ice cream shop might store customers' favorite flavors in a custom field, and you can create custom fields that make sense for your business.  With custom fields, you can also create [segments](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/segmenting-contacts-v2/) based on custom fields values. Your custom fields are completely customizable to the use-cases and user information that you need.  You can also manage your Custom Fields using the SendGrid application user interface. See [**Using Custom Fields**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/managing-contacts/custom-fields) for more information, including a list of Reserved Fields. You can also manage your custom fields in the [Marketing Campaigns application user interface](https://mc.sendgrid.com/custom-fields).

// **This endpoint creates a new custom field definition.**  Custom field definitions are created with the given `name` and `field_type`. Although field names are stored in a case-sensitive manner, all field names must be case-insensitively unique. This means you may create a field named `CamelCase` or `camelcase`, but not both. Additionally, a Custom Field name cannot collide with any Reserved Field names. You should save the returned `id` value in order to update or delete the field at a later date. You can have up to 500 custom fields.  The custom field name should be created using only alphanumeric characters (A-Z and 0-9) and underscores (\\_). Custom fields can only begin with letters  A-Z or underscores (_). The field type can be date, text, or number fields. The field type is important for creating segments from your contact database.  **Note: Creating a custom field that begins with a number will cause issues with sending in Marketing Campaigns.**
