* The Twilio SendGrid Account Provisioning API provides a platform for Twilio SendGrid resellers to manage their customer accounts. This API is for companies that have a formal reseller partnership with Twilio SendGrid.  You can access Twilio SendGrid sub-account functionality without becoming a reseller. If you require sub-account functionality, see the Twilio [SendGrid Subusers](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/subusers) feature, which is available with [Pro and Premier plans](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/).
