* Twilio SendGrid API Keys API
* The Twilio SendGrid API Keys API allows you manage your API keys and their settings. Your application, mail client, or website can all use API keys to authenticate access to SendGrid services.  To create your initial SendGrid API Key, you should use the [SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys). Once you have created a first key with scopes to manage additional API keys, you can use this API for all other key management.
