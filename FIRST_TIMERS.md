# How To Contribute to SendGrid Repositories via GitHub

Contributing to the SendGrid is easy! All you need to do is find an open issue (see the bottom of this page for a list of repositories containing open issues), fix it and submit a pull request. Once you have submitted your pull request, the team can easily review it before it is merged into the repository.

To make a pull request, follow these steps:

1. Log into GitHub. If you do not already have a GitHub account, you will have to create one in order to submit a change. Click the Sign up link in the upper right-hand corner to create an account. Enter your username, password, and email address. If you are an employee of SendGrid, please use your full name with your GitHub account and enter SendGrid as your company so we can easily identify you.

Once signed in, go to the repository you want to modify. There are two different options: either modifying the file directly on the GitHub website (useful when it is a single file) or forking the repository.

### Single file modification

2. Once you are viewing a file you want to modify in GitHub, click the pencil icon to begin editing:

3. Once you have made your changes, you will be given the option of creating a new branch in a Pull Request. This is a request to create a copy, or branch, of the original Docs but with your changes. Once your changes are approved, your branch will then be merged back into the original. 

4. To create a Pull Request, youâ€™ll have to fill out a Commit Changes form. Follow the built-in template and provide information about any changes you have made to the page. Leave the default branch option and name.

5. When done, click **Propose file change**. The team will be notified of your request, and will be able to process it.

### Forking the repository

2. Once you are viewing the repository, click the **Fork** button (top right corner) to create a new fork. Doing so will create a fork of the repository that you will be able to access from your profile.

3. Make changes to the fork, either by using the web interface as described above or by [cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your repository.

4. Once you have made your changes, if they have been made in your local machine, you will need to commit the changes and push them to GitHub.

5. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository).

### Important notice

Before creating a pull request, make sure that you respect the repository's constraints regarding contributions. You can find them in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
